<p>The <code>hrbrthemes</code> package has two goals. First, it provides
a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where
various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used. The second
goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact,
this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of
<code>hrbrthemes</code> should be used.</p>
<p>A “production workflow” is when you intend for the output of your
work to be put into a publication of some kind, whether it be a blog
post, academic paper, presentation, internal report or industry
publication. When you’re cranking through an analysis, the visual
elements don’t need to be perfect. They are there to validate/support
your work and are more of a starting point for the finished product than
anything else. The level of attention to detail on the final graphical
products can be a great motivator for your audience to either dive deep
into your analysis text or relegate it to the TLDR pile.</p>

</h2>
<p>There are nigh countless tomes written about the colors you should
consider using in charts as well as how to produce “minimal” charts
(i.e. eliminate “chart junk”). One area that is rarely discussed is the
use of fonts in charts (i.e. chart typography). The
<code>hrbrthemes</code> package is <em>very opinionated</em> about chart
typography:</p>
<ul>
<li>The font family used should be <strong>sans-serif</strong>
typeface</li>
<li>The font family used should have an awesome, default
<strong>kern[ing] table</strong>
</li>
<li>The font family used should have <strong>tabular figures</strong>
(digits) vs <em>proportional</em> ones</li>
<li>The font family used should be a <strong>condensed</strong> or
<strong>narrow</strong> typeface</li>
<li>Ideally, the font family used will have 100, 300, 500, 700 and 900
weights vs regular, bold, italic and bold italic</li>
<li>Because we’re working in <code>ggplot2</code>-land, the font family
used should also be a TrueType font (TTF)</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-sans-serif">Why <strong>sans-serif</strong>?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-sans-serif"></a>
</h3>
<p>To use a gross oversimplification, there are two basic font types:
<span style="font-family:serif">Serif</span> and <span style="font-family:sans-serif">Sans-serif</span> (that’s a lie of
convenience, there are more than two). <code>hrbrthemes</code> suggests
using sans-serif fonts since they have a more “modern” feel to them,
you’re not producing long-form text and labels on charts may need to
scale down to small sizes. Typography nerds on either side of the serif
vs sans-serif debate can point to 100+ years of research-based evidence
supporting their particular “side”.</p>
<p>You can compare the typography in the two
(non-<code>hrbrthemes</code>) charts below to see if you prefer
sans-serif over serif:</p>
<p><img src="why_hrbrthemes_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>If you work in a company, your communications department likely has a
set of core brand fonts and said font groups likely contain both serif
and sans-serif and you should strive to keep with the brand image and
use whatever font(s) work best or work with your comms team to pick a
standard, complementary font for the charts you produce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="kern-what">Kern-what?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#kern-what"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning" class="external-link">Kerning</a> is
nothing more than a fancy word for spaces between letters and fonts have
built-in tables for how various pairs of letters should be placed next
to each other. Great fonts have kerning tables that typography nerds
immediately recognize and adore. Fonts with poor kerning tables are
easily recognized as such by even the least font-aware viewer.</p>
<center>
<p><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1015/" class="external-link"><img src="../../../../Statistical%20Programming840/biostat840-project3-pkgdown-haoxue-xiang/hrbrthemes/articles/kerning.png"></a><br><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1015/" class="external-link uri">https://www.xkcd.com/1015/</a></p>
</center>
<p>Bad kerning will be a distraction from the chart contents. Great
kerning will be a subconscious reinforcement of just how awesome your
visualizations are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="tabula-figura">Tabula Figura<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tabula-figura"></a>
</h3>
<p>Tabular digits line up when placed on top of each other. Proportional
ones do not. This is best explained visually:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../../../Statistical%20Programming840/biostat840-project3-pkgdown-haoxue-xiang/hrbrthemes/articles/numbers.png"></p>
</center>
<p>Can you spot the proportional digits from the tabular ones? (Hint:
there are two of each.)</p>
<p>Proportional digits stand out (in a “yes, I just spilled sriracha on
my white shirt” way) when used on the Y axis of a chart and the numeric
labels contain numbers of varying widths (like Hind and Encode Sans
Condensed in the example above). Using proportional digits will be one
further, subtle, subliminal message to viewers that there is something
not-quite-awesome about your creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="clean-and-compact">Clean and compact<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clean-and-compact"></a>
</h3>
<p>The figure used in the previous section provided an example of
condensed/narrow fonts and regular. Chart space is at a premium and it’s
important to label and annotate your creations (sparingly but
sufficiently). Choosing a font that is too wide will reduce your
available space and also make it harder to read the text. Choosing a
font that is too narrow/compressed/condensed will create different
legiibility problems.</p>
<p>NOTE: It’s <em>really</em> hard to find a <strong>free</strong>
condensed/narrow font with great kerning pairs and tabular digits. Such
is the way of things.</p>
<p>(As an aside, the default line-height for Hind and M+ 1c is also
sub-optimal and would require tweaking in <code>ggplot2</code> calls to
correct.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="weight--what">Weight. What?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weight--what"></a>
</h3>
<p>Most fonts (and, more importantly, most <em>free</em> fonts) come in
regular, <em>italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong> and bold italic (which I
can’t bring myself to code in here). You really want to avoid italic and
bold italic, especially at very small or very large sizes. Bold should
be used sparingly as it draws the eye to that text.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’d use a font with a broad diversity of <em>weights</em>.
The term <em>weight</em> can be though of as a numeric scale (the one
used here was introduced by TrueType) between 100 and 900 (usually at
100 or 200 increments) or with names ranging from “hairline” through
“ultra-black”.</p>
<p>Take Open Sans, for example:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="../../../../Statistical%20Programming840/biostat840-project3-pkgdown-haoxue-xiang/hrbrthemes/articles/weights.png"></p>
</center>
<p>There is plenty of room to work with in Open Sans. You can embolden
the title, but mute the other labels and choose appropriate label fonts
to both enhance style as well as reduce importance. Lighter weights are
great for captions and even some direct annotations. Heaver weights
should be used sparingly and for emphasis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ttf--meh-">TTF. Meh.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ttf--meh-"></a>
</h3>
<p>I’ll use another over-simplification and state that there two main
font types: OTF and TTF (it’s another lie of convenience). OTF
(OpenType) is more modern and flexible. TTF (TrueType) has been around
longer and was a precursor to OTF. If you make PDFs or PostScript files
from R you pretty much <em>need</em> to use TTF fonts due to the
underlying tooling that it relies on. If you are making PNGs or SVGs you
can likely use OTF but most communciations teams and publications want
PDFs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="spacing-out">Spacing Out<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spacing-out"></a>
</h2>
<p>Label/title placement is also important, as is the distance between
those elements. Put text bits too close to each other or too far apart
from each other will send negative subliminal messages. Centering vs
left- or right-justification will also convey other messages (old-school
vs modern, to put it somewhat bluntly).</p>
<p><code>hrbrthemes</code> makes opinionated choices over the spacing
between title elements and all labels. For some elements, it makes very
new choices (such as the justification of the axis labels).</p>
<p>The font choices you make may cause you to adjust the
<code>hrbrthemes</code> defaults, especially if you choose a font with a
wonky line-height.</p>
